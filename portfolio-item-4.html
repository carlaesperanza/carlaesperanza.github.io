        <h3>Challenges </h3>
        <li> Solving a problem that I was very familiar with, it was difficult to let go of my initial assumptions on what first-year students needed (information, guidance from experienced people) and design for what most students demonstrated a need for (self-accountability)</li>
        <li> To fit the 10-week time constraint I had to compromise certain features for the minimal viable product (MVP)</li>

       <br>
       <br>
       <b> Insights </b>
       <li> The “party” feature in Habitica that allows users to team to work towards common goals creates an element of accountability. </li>
       <li> The visuals in Goalscape and Lifetick help users look at their goals from a more logical perspective that encourages taking logical approaches towards their goals.</li>
       <li>  None of them appeal to a diverse group of people so a large portion of the audience gets disengaged after starting.
         <br>
- Habitica is not engaging or motivating for people who don’t like videogames
          <br>
- Lifetick and goalscape have a formal tone that appeals to professionals but seems boring to students. </li>

<li> The relationship between goals and their different components are not defined or not part of the system.
  <br>
  - Habitica has “Habits”, “Dailies” and “To-Dos”. All three are different types of small goals that do not relate to each other.
  <br>
- Goalscape makes it difficult to customize the importance of each sub goal and their relationship to each other is not clearly defined in the final state.
  <br>
- Lifetick only covers the management of small tasks. </li>

            <li> “When I’m going through something by myself I look for more personal ways to deal with it.” </li>

            <li> “I don’t think guidance counselors understand what I’m going through so I don’t think the steps that they outline for me are ever actually accurate.” </li>

            <li> “It was difficult for me to adapt to the new challenges but it made me more mature. When I had to go through it alone, I mostly missed the structure that someone else could provide.” </li>

            <h3>User Testing Results</h3>
            I conducted 2 rounds of user testing, each with 5 users. The first round showed users the digital wireframes and the second round allowed them to interact with a prototype.

    <li> 1st round key insights: </li>

  -   No user expected to see a timeline as the form of tracking. They expected to see a summary of what they had inputted.
  <br>
  -   Users did not know to click a section of the pie chart to get to the components of the sub goal.
    <br>

  <li>  2nd round key insights </li>

  -  2/5 users tried clicking on the onboarding images, thinking they would lead a corresponding section.
  <br>
  -  Users thought that the “goal status” was correlated to the points they had accumulated, not to the goal.
  <br>
  - Asked themselves before looking at the menu how they would create a new goal.
  <br>
  - Didn’t know how to go back to set the card number and ignored the “card settings” option.
          <br>
          <br>

            <h3>Conclusion </h3>

          <p> To move forward with this project </p>

<li> I must figure how to ensure that people aren’t only saying that they’re completing tasks and then getting points for it </li>
<li>  I want to incorporate a feature that allows them to show how many points they have gained to their friends as well as work together towards a common goal. </li>
<li>  I want to include a feature that gives users points (way larger amounts) for sharing “businesses” that acted as valuable resources for working towards their goal. </li>
